**<i>Tetris (Russian: Тетрис[a]) is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded the Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing.</i>**

<h3>Originally written in Pascal, before being ported to Pascal Turbo for PC, this rewrite will be in C. This is just an excercise for us, and we have no association with the Tetris Company. We are not sourcing the original code. We are just going to utilize what we are learning in school to replicate the logic of the game, while trying to emulate the original ASCII feel. Please don't sue us.</h3>
